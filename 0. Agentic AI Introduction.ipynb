Unlike standard AI systems that respond only to specific inputs, <u>Agentic AI combines **reasoning**, **planning**, and **acting** to solve complex tasks **autonomously** while interacting with its environment.</u>\n","\n","\n","Agentic AI is a type of AI thatâ€™s all about **autonomy**. This means it can make decisions, take actions, and even learn on its own to achieve specific goals.\n","\n","<br><br>\n","\n","**Example of Agentic AI in Action:** <br>\n","**Scenario:** Travel Planning Assistant.<br>\n","**A user asks an AI system:** \"Plan a 5-day trip to Paris, including flights, hotels, and sightseeing.\" <br>\n","\n","**How Agentic AI Works:** <br>\n","\n","1. **Goal Setting:** The AI identifies the goal (create a complete travel plan).\n","\n","2. **Planning:**\n","  * Searches for flights and compares prices.\n","  * Books a suitable hotel based on preferences.\n","  * Schedules sightseeing tours.\n","\n","3. **Dynamic Interaction:** Adjusts plans if flights or hotels are unavailable or if the user provides new input like, \"Include a visit to the Eiffel Tower.\"\n","\n","4. **Execution:** Finalizes bookings, creates an itinerary, and sends it to the user.\n","\n","**Output:** A complete itinerary with booked flights, hotel accommodations, and sightseeing activities, adaptable to last-minute changes.\n","\n","\n","<br><br>\n","\n","**How Agentic AI Work:**\n","Agentic AI operates in a cyclic process. <br>\n","\n","1. **Input Understanding:**\n","    Agentic AI begins by interpreting the userâ€™s query or task and defining a clear goal.\n","\n","    **`Example:`** For a query like \"Plan a 5-day trip to Paris,\" the AI identifies the objective: create a comprehensive travel itinerary.\n","\n","\n","2. **Planning or Multi-Step Planning:**\n","    Agentic AI creates a structured plan that breaks the goal into smaller, manageable subtasks.\n","\n","    **`Example:`**\n","    * **Task 1:** Search for flights.\n","    * **Task 2:** Book a hotel.\n","    * **Task 3:** Suggest sightseeing locations.\n","\n","\n","3. **Tool & Resources Usage:**\n","    Agentic AI interacts with tools, APIs, databases, or external systems to gather information and execute tasks.\n","\n","    **`Example:`**\n","    * Call a flight API to find the best prices.\n","    * Use a weather API to ensure sightseeing plans align with favourable weather.\n","\n","\n","4. **Iterative Reasoning and Decision-Making:**\n","    At every step, Agentic AI evaluates the intermediate results and updates its plan if necessary.\n","\n","    **`Example:`**\n","    * If no flights are available for the specified dates, the AI searches for nearby airports or adjusts the travel dates.\n","\n","\n","5. **Dynamic Adaptation:**\n","    Agentic AI dynamically adapts its actions based on user feedback or new data.\n","\n","    **`Example:`**\n","    * **User input:** \"Include a visit to the Eiffel Tower.\"\n","    * The AI modifies the sightseeing plan to prioritize this request.\n","\n","\n","6. **Feedback Loops:**\n","    Agentic AI integrates feedback loops to refine its decisions and outputs continuously.\n","\n","    **`Example:`**\n","    * After creating an itinerary, the AI asks: \"Does this plan meet your requirements?\" If the user requests changes, it revises the itinerary.\n","\n","7. **Final Output and Execution:**\n","    After completing all steps and ensuring alignment with the goal, Agentic AI presents the final result or executes the task.\n","\n","    **`Example:`**\n","    * Provide the full itinerary, including booked flights, hotel reservations, and sightseeing plans."],"metadata":{"id":"dJotpZgXWDNI"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"syxm_39SWC2z"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **Meaning of Reasoning in Agentic AI:**\n","\n","\n","**Reasoning** in **Agentic AI** refers to the process by which the AI system logically analyzes a situation, formulates a plan, and makes decisions to achieve a given goal.\n","\n","It involves breaking down complex tasks into smaller steps, considering various possibilities, and iteratively refining its approach based on new information or outcomes.\n","<br><br>\n","\n","**How Reasoning Works in Agentic AI:** <br>\n","1. **Understanding the Task:** The AI interprets the user's request or the problem it needs to solve.\n","\n","2. **Planning:** It generates a logical sequence of steps or sub-goals to reach the solution.\n","\n","3. **Decision-Making:** The AI selects the most appropriate actions based on the reasoning process.\n","\n","4. **Adaptation:** It adjusts its plan based on the results of its actions and any new data it receives.\n","<br><br>\n","\n","\n","**Example: Reasoning in a Travel Planning Agent** <br>\n","**User Query:** \"Plan a 5-day trip to Tokyo, including flights, hotel reservations, and sightseeing.\" <br>\n","\n","**Reasoning Process:**\n","\n","1. **Unserstanding:** The agent identifies the goal: create a travel itinerary for Tokyo.\n","\n","2. **Planning:**\n","  * **Step 1:** Search for flights to Tokyo.\n","  * **Step 2:** Book a hotel near major attractions.\n","  * **Step 3:** List popular sightseeing spots for a 5-day visit.\n","\n","3. **Decision-Making:**\n","  * Chooses the best flight based on price and timing.\n","  * Selects a hotel that fits within the budget and location preferences.\n","  * Picks sightseeing spots based on user interests and reviews.\n","\n","4. **Adaptation:**\n","  * If flights are too expensive, the agent might suggest alternate travel dates.\n","  * If the user prefers cultural experiences, it updates the sightseeing plan to include museums and temples.\n","\n","\n","**Final Output:** Give a complete travel itinerary that includes flights, hotel details, and a daily plan for sightseeing in Tokyo.\n","<br><br>\n","\n","**Importance of Reasoning in Agentic AI:**\n","\n","* **Handles Complex Queries:** Breaks down multi-faceted tasks into manageable steps.\n","\n","* **Improves Decision-Making:** Ensures that each action is logically derived and contributes toward the goal.\n","\n","* **Enhances Flexibility:** Adapts plans based on real-time feedback or changing conditions.\n","\n","* **Reduces Errors:** Iterative reasoning allows the AI to correct mistakes and refine its approach.\n","<br><br>\n","\n","Reasoning is what makes Agentic AI capable of dealing with dynamic and uncertain environments effectively, ensuring that the AI acts logically and efficiently to meet user needs.
