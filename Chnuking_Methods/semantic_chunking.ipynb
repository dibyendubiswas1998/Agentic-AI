    "# **Semantic Chunking:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Semantic Chunking** is a method of breaking down a document into smaller, meaningful units by grouping text segments that share a similar meaning or topic, rather than by fixed-size or simple sentence boundaries. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **What is Semantic Chunking:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Semantic chunking* is a method to split (or segment) a long text into smaller ‚Äúchunks‚Äù (segments) not just by raw size (fixed number of tokens/characters) but by **semantic similarity/boundaries**. The goal is to make each chunk relatively coherent in meaning, so that each is more ‚Äúself-contained‚Äù in terms of topic, idea, or sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to simpler split strategies (e.g. splitting every *n* sentences or *n* tokens), semantic chunking tries to find *natural breakpoints* based on how meaning shifts in the text, using embeddings (vector representations) to detect those shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **How LangChain‚Äôs `SemanticChunker` works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain has an experimental component `SemanticChunker` (in `langchain_experimental.text_splitter`) which implements semantic chunking. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are its main characteristics, parameters, and algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Steps / Algorithm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sentence splitting**\n",
    "   First, the text is split into sentences using a regex (default: splittings after `.`, `?`, `!` followed by whitespace). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create embeddings**\n",
    "   Each sentence (or maybe each small group) is converted into embeddings (vector form) using a provided embeddings model. This lets the algorithm measure ‚Äúsemantic distance‚Äù between sentences. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initial grouping**\n",
    "   There is a grouping step: for example, grouping every 3 sentences as a base chunk. This is a starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Detect ‚Äúbreakpoints‚Äù where meaning shifts**\n",
    "   After having sentences (or initial small chunks) with embeddings, it measures distances (or differences) between neighbouring sentences / chunks. If the distance is *large enough* (more than some threshold), that indicates a semantic ‚Äúbreak‚Äù ‚Äî that is, a good place to split. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Merge or adjust chunks**\n",
    "   Depending on how close neighbouring chunks are, some may be merged; also other constraints like minimum chunk size or buffer size may influence the final segmentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Thresholding strategy**\n",
    "   There are different strategies to decide what ‚Äúlarge enough‚Äù means. `SemanticChunker` supports multiple types:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `Percentile`: e.g., take all pairwise distances, find the X-th percentile (default 95%), use that as threshold. \n",
    "   * `Standard Deviation`: threshold based on number of standard deviations above mean difference. \n",
    "   * `Interquartile`: using IQR (interquartile range) to define threshold. \n",
    "   * `Gradient`: detect anomalies in gradients of distances (i.e. sudden jumps) to find natural split points. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Other parameters / constraints**\n",
    "   There are other knobs:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `buffer_size` (int): controls some kind of overlapping / buffer of context around splits. \n",
    "   * `min_chunk_size`: minimum size (in terms of something, e.g. number of sentences) a chunk must have. Prevents overly small chunks. [1])\n",
    "   * `sentence_split_regex`: custom regex to split into sentences. \n",
    "   * `add_start_index`: whether to store some start index metadata. \n",
    "   * `number_of_chunks`: possibly limit desired number of chunks. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example (from LangChain docs)\n",
    "\n",
    "* They load a long document (‚ÄúState of the Union‚Äù) and invoke `SemanticChunker(OpenAIEmbeddings())` to split. \n",
    "* With the default settings, this creates many chunks (e.g. 26) for the document.\n",
    "* Changing the `breakpoint_threshold_type` from `percentile` to `standard_deviation` or `interquartile` results in different chunking (fewer or more, depending on how strict the threshold is). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits and Trade-offs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Chunks align more closely to shifts in topic or meaning ‚Üí better for downstream tasks like summarization, question answering, retrieval, etc., since each chunk is more semantically coherent.\n",
    "* Can reduce noise: avoids cutting off in the middle of a topic just because of a token limit or fixed chunk size.\n",
    "* More adaptive: documents with different structures will be chunked differently based on content, not just length.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trade-offs / challenges:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Computational cost**: embedding every sentence, computing distances etc. can be more expensive than simpler fixed splits.\n",
    "* **Parameter sensitivity**: thresholds (percentile / std dev / IQR etc.), minimum sizes etc. need tuning. If threshold too low, too many splits ‚Üí many small chunks, maybe too fragmented. If too high, you may miss meaningful topic shifts.\n",
    "* **Dependence on embedding quality**: If embeddings aren‚Äôt good, semantic similarity/distance estimates may be noisy, leading to weird splits.\n",
    "* **Not always perfect**: sudden shifts in writing style or rhetorical devices may mislead; some ‚Äúsemantic shifts‚Äù may not align with what a human would want as a chunk break.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to use Semantic Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "You might prefer semantic chunking when:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The text is long, varied, covers multiple topics or subtopics.\n",
    "* You will perform downstream tasks like semantic search, retrieval, QA, summarization etc. where coherent sub-units help.\n",
    "* You want chunk sizes to reflect meaning rather than arbitrary lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## **Understand the Different types of Breakpoints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Percentile Breakpoint**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **How it works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Compute the semantic distance between consecutive sentences (using embeddings).\n",
    "  * Collect all these distances.\n",
    "  * Choose a threshold = the *X-th percentile* of all distances (default: 95th).\n",
    "  * A distance bigger than that threshold ‚Üí mark it as a breakpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Example:**\n",
    "  Distances between 8 sentence pairs:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  [0.1, 0.15, 0.12, 0.55, 0.18, 0.2, 0.9, 0.16]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  * 95th percentile ‚âà 0.87.\n",
    "  * Distances above 0.87 ‚Üí `[0.9]`.\n",
    "  * Breakpoint occurs before the last pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Effect:** Splits only at the largest ‚Äúsemantic jumps.‚Äù\n",
    "  ‚Üí Good for long documents with few big topic shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Standard Deviation Breakpoint**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **How it works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Compute mean and standard deviation of all distances.\n",
    "  * Breakpoints = distances above **mean + N√óstd** (N is configurable, e.g. 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Example:**\n",
    "  Distances:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  [0.1, 0.15, 0.12, 0.55, 0.18, 0.2, 0.9, 0.16]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Mean ‚âà 0.29\n",
    "  * Std ‚âà 0.27\n",
    "  * Threshold = 0.29 + 2√ó0.27 = 0.83\n",
    "  * Distances above 0.83 ‚Üí `[0.9]`\n",
    "  * Breakpoint at the same spot as Percentile in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Effect:** Adapts to overall variance. Works well if distances are normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Interquartile Breakpoint (IQR method)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **How it works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Compute 25th percentile (Q1) and 75th percentile (Q3).\n",
    "  * IQR = Q3 - Q1.\n",
    "  * Threshold = Q3 + k√óIQR (usually k=1.5).\n",
    "  * Breakpoints = distances above this threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Example:**\n",
    "  Distances:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  [0.1, 0.15, 0.12, 0.55, 0.18, 0.2, 0.9, 0.16]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Sorted: `[0.1, 0.12, 0.15, 0.16, 0.18, 0.2, 0.55, 0.9]`\n",
    "  * Q1 = 0.14, Q3 = 0.375 ‚Üí IQR = 0.235\n",
    "  * Threshold = 0.375 + 1.5√ó0.235 = 0.727\n",
    "  * Distances above 0.727 ‚Üí `[0.9]`\n",
    "  * Breakpoint at last pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Effect:** Robust to outliers. Works well if a few jumps are much larger than the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Gradient Breakpoint**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **How it works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Look at the *change in distances* between consecutive pairs (the gradient).\n",
    "  * If the gradient suddenly spikes, mark as breakpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Example:**\n",
    "  Distances:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  [0.1, 0.15, 0.12, 0.55, 0.18, 0.2, 0.9, 0.16]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Gradients:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * 0.1 ‚Üí 0.15 = +0.05\n",
    "    * 0.15 ‚Üí 0.12 = -0.03\n",
    "    * 0.12 ‚Üí 0.55 = +0.43 ‚Üê **big jump**\n",
    "    * 0.55 ‚Üí 0.18 = -0.37\n",
    "    * 0.18 ‚Üí 0.2 = +0.02\n",
    "    * 0.2 ‚Üí 0.9 = +0.7 ‚Üê **big jump**\n",
    "    * 0.9 ‚Üí 0.16 = -0.74\n",
    "  * Breakpoints at jumps `+0.43` and `+0.7`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Effect:** Finds *sudden shifts* in topic even if absolute distance isn‚Äôt extreme. Good for detecting subtle turning points.\n",

    "## **Example - How Semantic Chunking Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compute distances ‚Üí decide breakpoints**\n",
    "2. **Use breakpoints to slice the text into chunks**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let‚Äôs go step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîπ Step 1: Start with Sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic chunking begins with splitting the document into **sentences** (or very small segments).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example text (6 sentences):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "S1: The U.S. President delivered a speech on healthcare reform.  \n",
    "S2: He emphasized the importance of affordable coverage.  \n",
    "S3: Later, he shifted to foreign policy and national security.  \n",
    "S4: He discussed recent diplomatic talks with allies.  \n",
    "S5: The speech ended with remarks about climate change.  \n",
    "S6: New funding was announced for renewable energy projects.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîπ Step 2: Breakpoints from Distances\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we computed embedding distances between consecutive sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "S1‚ÄìS2: 0.1\n",
    "S2‚ÄìS3: 0.65   ‚Üê Breakpoint (topic shift: healthcare ‚Üí foreign policy)\n",
    "S3‚ÄìS4: 0.15\n",
    "S4‚ÄìS5: 0.7    ‚Üê Breakpoint (foreign policy ‚Üí climate change)\n",
    "S5‚ÄìS6: 0.2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the chosen method (Percentile, Std Dev, IQR, Gradient), we got **breakpoints at S2‚ÄìS3 and S4‚ÄìS5**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîπ Step 3: Select the Chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we **cut** the text at those breakpoints:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Chunk 1:** `[S1, S2]` ‚Üí Healthcare\n",
    "* **Chunk 2:** `[S3, S4]` ‚Üí Foreign policy\n",
    "* **Chunk 3:** `[S5, S6]` ‚Üí Climate change\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîπ Step 4: Adjust with Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain‚Äôs `SemanticChunker` allows tuning:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **min\\_chunk\\_size** ‚Üí ensures you don‚Äôt end up with too tiny chunks (e.g., at least 3 sentences).\n",
    "* **buffer\\_size** ‚Üí allows overlap (carry over context across boundaries).\n",
    "* **number\\_of\\_chunks** ‚Üí limit max chunks (force merging if needed).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "If `min_chunk_size = 3`, then instead of splitting into 3 small chunks, the algorithm might merge Chunk 2 and 3 ‚Üí `[S3, S4, S5, S6]`.\n",

    "## **SemanticChunker Method's Arguments:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **buffer\\_size (int)**\n",
    "  * **What it is:** adds a small amount of **overlap** around every breakpoint so adjacent chunks keep a bit of shared context.\n",
    "  * **How it works:** after splitting, the chunker copies `buffer_size` sentences from the *end* of chunk *i* to the *beginning* of chunk *i+1*.\n",
    "  * **Example:** if a split lands between S2 and S3 and `buffer_size=1`\n",
    "    * Chunk A: `[S1, S2]`\n",
    "    * Chunk B (with buffer): `[S2, S3, S4, ‚Ä¶]`\n",
    "      This helps downstream QA avoid losing pronoun references or definitions at boundaries. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **add\\_start\\_index (bool)**\n",
    "  * **What it is:** stores the **character start index** (in the original text) for each produced chunk in metadata.\n",
    "  * **Why it‚Äôs useful:** lets you map chunks back to the original document for highlighting, citations, or UI offsets.\n",
    "  * **Example:** a returned `Document` may have `metadata={\"start_index\": 1423}` so you can jump the user to that exact spot. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **number\\_of\\_chunks (int | None)**\n",
    "  * **What it is:** an optional **target count** of chunks to produce.\n",
    "  * **How it works:** the splitter adjusts its breakpoints (e.g., by relaxing/tightening the threshold) or merges/splits to land near this number.\n",
    "  * **When to use:** you want predictable paging‚Äîfor instance, ‚Äúgive me \\~12 chunks for this chapter so I can show one per screen.‚Äù\n",
    "  * **Example:** if natural breaks would yield 20 chunks but `number_of_chunks=12`, nearby boundaries are softened/merged to approach 12 coherent segments. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **sentence\\_split\\_regex (str)**\n",
    "  * **What it is:** the **regex** used for the very first pass of splitting into sentences before any semantic logic. Default: `r\"(?<=[.?!])\\s+\"` (split on `.?!` followed by whitespace).\n",
    "  * **Why it matters:** better sentence detection ‚Üí better embeddings ‚Üí better breakpoint detection.\n",
    "  * **Example tweaks:**\n",
    "    * Include colons/semicolons for technical prose: `r\"(?<=[.?!;:])\\s+\"`\n",
    "    * Keep abbreviations from splitting (e.g., ‚ÄúU.S.‚Äù) by using a more careful regex/tokenizer. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **min\\_chunk\\_size (int | None)**\n",
    "  * **What it is:** a **floor** on how small a chunk can be (in sentences).\n",
    "  * **How it works:** after finding breakpoints, if a candidate chunk would have fewer than `min_chunk_size` sentences, it gets **merged** with a neighbor to avoid tiny, low-signal chunks.\n",
    "  * **Example:** natural breaks yield `[S1,S2] | [S3] | [S4,S5,S6]`. With `min_chunk_size=2`, the middle singleton `[S3]` merges with a neighbor ‚Üí `[S1,S2,S3] | [S4,S5,S6]`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Putting it all together (mini scenario)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Text of 9 sentences (S1‚Ä¶S9). Semantic distances suggest breaks after S3 and S6.\n",

    "  * Chunk 3: `[S6,S7,S8,S9]` (S6 buffered)\n",
    "* **With `min_chunk_size=4`:** merge to avoid short chunks ‚Üí `[S1‚ÄìS6] | [S7‚ÄìS9]` (and then apply buffer if set).\n",

Primary results showed clinically meaningful and statistically\\n\\n\\nsignificant improvement in overall survival (OS) and progression‚Äêfree\\n\\nsurvival versus placebo plus chemotherapy. [1]\\n\\n\\nTreatments often intend to extend OS and maintain or improve\\n\\n\\nquality of life (QoL); however, treatment‚Äêrelated toxicity can\\n\\n\\n\\ndeteriorate QoL among patients with advanced NSCLC. [2] The\\n\\n\\nimprovement, maintenance, or delay in deterioration in QoL is an\\n\\n\\nimportant goal in advanced NSCLC, for which treatment is palliative. Disease‚Äêrelated symptoms of pain, dyspnea, and cough are reported\\n\\nto have a substantial negative effect on lung cancer‚Äìspecific QoL. [3,4]\\n\\n\\nWhen assessing novel therapies, it is therefore necessary to consider\\n\\n\\npatient‚Äêreported outcomes (PROs) as a key component of benefit‚Äê\\n\\n\\nrisk profile evaluation. Such measurements are important when\\n\\n\\ndetermining the quality of the time gained by delaying cancer pro\\n\\ngression and improving survival. Cemiplimab monotherapy was\\n\\n\\nshown in the EMPOWER‚ÄêLung 1 trial to significantly improve QoL,\\n\\n\\nfunctioning, and most symptoms versus platinum‚Äêdoublet chemo\\n\\ntherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC and PD‚ÄêL1 expression\\n\\n‚â•50%. [5] Top‚Äêlevel PRO results of EMPOWER‚ÄêLung 3 were recently\\n\\npresented. [6] This study reports detailed cancer‚Äêrelated and lung\\n\\n\\ncancer‚Äìspecific PROs from the EMPOWER‚ÄêLung 3 trial. -----\\n\\n**2258**\\n\\n\\n\\n- PROS OF 1L CEMIPLIMAB + CHEMOTHERAPY IN ANSCLC\\n\\n\\n\\n**MATERIALS AND METHODS**\\n\\n\\n**Study design and participants**\\n\\n\\nThe EMPOWER‚ÄêLung 3 study [7] was a multicenter, multinational,\\n\\n\\nrandomized, placebo‚Äêcontrolled, double‚Äêblind, phase 3 trial\\n\\n\\ncomparing the efficacy, safety, and PROs of cemiplimab (350 mg)\\n\\n\\nevery 3 weeks intravenous plus investigator's choice of platinum‚Äê\\n\\n\\ndoublet chemotherapy (paclitaxel plus carboplatin or cisplatin,\\n\\n\\npemetrexed plus carboplatin or cisplatin) versus placebo plus\\n\\n\\nchemotherapy using 2:1 randomization in patients with stage IIIB,\\n\\n\\nIIIC, or stage IV nonsquamous or squamous NSCLC with no _EGFR_\\n\\n\\nmutation, _ALK_ mutation, or _ROS1_ fusion (Figure S1). **PRO assessments**\\n\\n\\nPROs were assessed as secondary end points using the European\\n\\n\\nOrganisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life‚Äê\\n\\n\\nCore 30 (EORTC QLQ‚ÄêC30, version 3.0) questionnaire and its Lung\\n\\n\\nCancer Module (QLQ‚ÄêLC13) using patient self‚Äêadministered paper\\n\\n\\nforms at day 1 (baseline), the start of each treatment cycle (every\\n\\n\\n3 weeks) for the first six doses, then at the start of every three cycles,\\n\\n\\nand at the end of treatment, or end of study for patients who dis\\n\\ncontinued treatment due to progressive disease. The EORTC QLQ‚ÄêC30 is a clinically validated measure of QoL\\n\\n\\ncomprising five multi‚Äêitem functioning subscales, three multi‚Äêitem\\n\\n\\nsymptom scales, a global health status (GHS)/QoL subscale, and six\\n\\n\\nsingle‚Äêitem symptom scales assessing other disease‚Äê and treatment‚Äê\\n\\nrelated symptoms. [8] The EORTC QLQ‚ÄêLC13 is a clinically validated\\n\\n\\nlung cancer‚Äìspecific module comprising multi‚Äêitem and single‚Äêitem\\n\\n\\nmeasures of lung cancer‚Äìassociated symptoms (i.e., coughing, he\\n\\nmoptysis, dyspnea, site‚Äêspecific pain) and side‚Äêeffects from therapy\\n\\n(i.e., hair loss, neuropathy, sore mouth, dysphagia). [9] All responses to\\n\\n\\nitems are normalized to a 0‚Äì100 scale using a standard scoring al\\ngorithm. [10] For functioning and GHS/QoL scales, higher scores\\n\\n\\ncorrespond to a better level of functioning and QoL. For symptom\\n\\n\\nscales, a higher score corresponds to a higher level of symptom\\n\\n\\nseverity. Thus, a negative change from baseline in symptom scales\\n\\n\\ncorresponds to an improvement and a positive change corresponds\\n\\n\\nto deterioration. Conversely, a negative change from baseline in\\n\\n\\nfunctioning and GHS/QoL scales corresponds to deterioration, and a\\n\\n\\npositive change corresponds to improvement. **Statistical analysis**\\n\\n\\nAll PRO analyses presented are prespecified and used the full analysis\\n\\n\\nset (FAS), defined as all patients to whom study treatment was assigned\\n\\n\\nby randomization. Time‚Äêto‚Äêevent analyses were performed on the FAS. The longitudinal change‚Äêfrom‚Äêbaseline analyses were done on the FAS\\n\\n\\nwith patients who had a baseline PRO assessment and at least one PRO\\n\\n\\nassessment after baseline. Completion rates were summarized. To estimate longitudinal changes from baseline in EORTC QLQ‚Äê\\n\\n\\nC30 and QLQ‚ÄêLC13 scales, we used a longitudinal mixed‚Äêeffects\\n\\n\\nmodel for repeated measures (MMRM) with time, therapy, therapy\\n\\n\\nby time, histology (nonsquamous, squamous), PD‚ÄêL1 expression level\\n\\n\\n(<1%, 1‚Äì49%, ‚â•50%), baseline, and baseline by time as covariates. This MMRM analysis was performed on the changes from baseline\\n\\n\\nfor EORTC QLQ‚ÄêC30 and QLQ‚ÄêLC13 scales; overall change from\\n\\n\\nbaseline was estimated using least square means across time points. We also performed an analysis of time to definitive clinically mean\\n\\ningful deterioration (TTD) in all functioning and symptom scales. We\\n\\n\\ndefined definitive clinically meaningful deterioration in GHS/QoL and\\n\\n\\nfunctioning scales as the time from randomization to the first\\n\\n\\nobservation with a greater than or equal to 10‚Äêpoint decrease and no\\n\\n\\nsubsequent observations with a less than 10‚Äêpoint decrease from\\n\\n\\nbaseline or until patient drop‚Äêout resulting in missing data. In the\\n\\n\\ncase of missing items, the scores were calculated as indicated in the\\n\\n\\nscoring manuals for each of the PRO instruments. No imputation of\\n\\n\\nthe items was performed. We defined definitive clinically meaningful deterioration in the\\n\\n\\nsymptom scales as the time from randomization to the first\\n\\n\\nobservation with a greater than or equal to 10‚Äêpoint increase and\\n\\n\\nno subsequent observations with a less than 10‚Äêpoint increase\\n\\n\\nfrom baseline or until patient drop‚Äêout resulting in missing data. Established 10‚Äêpoint threshold value for minimally important dif\\nferences from the patient perspective were used. [11] Patients who\\n\\n\\ndid not satisfy the deterioration criteria were censored at the time\\n\\n\\nof last available PRO assessment. Survival analysis methods used\\n\\n\\nthe Kaplan‚ÄìMeier approach for estimating medians and percen\\n\\ntiles, the Brookmeyer and Crowley method for computing 95%\\n\\n\\nconfidence intervals (CIs), the stratified Cox proportional hazards\\n\\n\\nmodel assuming proportional hazards for computing hazard ratio\\n\\n\\n(HR), and the stratified log‚Äêrank test in comparing TTD between\\n\\n\\ntreatment arms. The same stratification factors used for random\\n\\nization (Figure S1) were applied to both the stratified log‚Äêrank test\\n\\n\\nand the stratified Cox model. Statistical comparisons were made at\\n\\n\\nŒ± = 0.05, and two‚Äêsided _p_ values were calculated with no multi\\n\\nplicity adjustments made.\""

No analyses yielded statistically significant PRO\\n\\n\\nresults favoring placebo plus chemotherapy for any QLQ‚ÄêC30 or QLQ‚ÄêLC13 scale. **Conclusion:** Cemiplimab plus chemotherapy resulted in significant overall\\n\\n\\nimprovement in pain symptoms and delayed TTD in cancer‚Äêrelated and lung cancer‚Äì\\n\\n\\nspecific symptoms and functions. **K E Y W O R D S**\\n\\nadvanced non‚Äìsmall cell lung cancer, cemiplimab, non‚Äìsmall cell lung cancer, patient‚Äêreported\\n\\noutcome, quality of life\\n\\n\\n\\n**INTRODUCTION**\\n\\n\\nIn the EMPOWER‚ÄêLung 3 trial (NCT03409614), the efficacy and\\n\\n\\nsafety of cemiplimab‚Äîa human immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal\\n\\n\\nantibody to the programmed cell death‚Äê1 (PD‚Äê1) receptor‚Äîplus in\\n\\nvestigator's choice of platinum‚Äêdoublet chemotherapy were\\n\\n\\ncompared with placebo plus chemotherapy for the first‚Äêline treat\\n\\nment of patients with advanced squamous or nonsquamous non‚Äì\\n\\n\\nsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) regardless of PD‚Äêligand 1 (PD‚ÄêL1)\\n\\n\\nexpression and with no anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( _ALK_ ), epidermal\\n\\n\\ngrowth factor receptor ( _EGFR_ ), or c‚ÄêRos oncogene 1 ( _ROS1_ ) aberra\\n\\ntions. Primary results showed clinically meaningful and statistically\\n\\n\\nsignificant improvement in overall survival (OS) and progression‚Äêfree\\n\\nsurvival versus placebo plus chemotherapy. [1]\\n\\n\\nTreatments often intend to extend OS and maintain or improve\\n\\n\\nquality of life (QoL); however, treatment‚Äêrelated toxicity can\\n\\n\\n\\ndeteriorate QoL among patients with advanced NSCLC. [2] The\\n\\n\\nimprovement, maintenance, or delay in deterioration in QoL is an\\n\\n\\nimportant goal in advanced NSCLC, for which treatment is palliative. Disease‚Äêrelated symptoms of pain, dyspnea, and cough are reported\\n\\nto have a substantial negative effect on lung cancer‚Äìspecific QoL. [3,4]\\n\\n\\nWhen assessing novel therapies, it is therefore necessary to consider\\n\\n\\npatient‚Äêreported outcomes (PROs) as a key component of benefit‚Äê\\n\\n\\nrisk profile evaluation. Such measurements are important when\\n\\n\\ndetermining the quality of the time gained by delaying cancer pro\\n\\ngression and improving survival. Cemiplimab monotherapy was\\n\\n\\nshown in the EMPOWER‚ÄêLung 1 trial to significantly improve QoL,\\n\\n\\nfunctioning, and most symptoms versus platinum‚Äêdoublet chemo\\n\\ntherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC and PD‚ÄêL1 expression\\n\\n‚â•50%. [5] Top‚Äêlevel PRO results of EMPOWER‚ÄêLung 3 were recently\\n\\npresented. [6] This study reports detailed cancer‚Äêrelated and lung\\n\\n\\ncancer‚Äìspecific PROs from the EMPOWER‚ÄêLung 3 trial. -----\\n\\n**2258**\\n\\n\\n\\n- PROS OF 1L CEMIPLIMAB + CHEMOTHERAPY IN ANSCLC\\n\\n\\n\\n**MATERIALS AND METHODS**\\n\\n\\n**Study design and participants**\\n\\n\\nThe EMPOWER‚ÄêLung 3 study [7] was a multicenter, multinational,\\n\\n\\nrandomized, placebo‚Äêcontrolled, double‚Äêblind, phase 3 trial\\n\\n\\ncomparing the efficacy, safety, and PROs of cemiplimab (350 mg)\\n\\n\\nevery 3 weeks intravenous plus investigator's choice of platinum‚Äê\\n\\n\\ndoublet chemotherapy (paclitaxel plus carboplatin or cisplatin,\\n\\n\\npemetrexed plus carboplatin or cisplatin) versus placebo plus\\n\\n\\nchemotherapy using 2:1 randomization in patients with stage IIIB,\\n\\n\\nIIIC, or stage IV nonsquamous or squamous NSCLC with no _EGFR_\\n\\n\\nmutation, _ALK_ mutation, or _ROS1_ fusion (Figure S1). **PRO assessments**\\n\\n\\nPROs were assessed as secondary end points using the European\\n\\n\\nOrganisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life‚Äê\\n\\n\\nCore 30 (EORTC QLQ‚ÄêC30, version 3.0) questionnaire and its Lung\\n\\n\\nCancer Module (QLQ‚ÄêLC13) using patient self‚Äêadministered paper\\n\\n\\nforms at day 1 (baseline), the start of each treatment cycle (every\\n\\n\\n3 weeks) for the first six doses, then at the start of every three cycles,\\n\\n\\nand at the end of treatment, or end of study for patients who dis\\n\\ncontinued treatment due to progressive disease. The EORTC QLQ‚ÄêC30 is a clinically validated measure of QoL\\n\\n\\ncomprising five multi‚Äêitem functioning subscales, three multi‚Äêitem\\n\\n\\nsymptom scales, a global health status (GHS)/QoL subscale, and six\\n\\n\\nsingle‚Äêitem symptom scales assessing other disease‚Äê and treatment‚Äê\\n\\nrelated symptoms. [8] The EORTC QLQ‚ÄêLC13 is a clinically validated\\n\\n\\nlung cancer‚Äìspecific module comprising multi‚Äêitem and single‚Äêitem\\n\\n\\nmeasures of lung cancer‚Äìassociated symptoms (i.e., coughing, he\\n\\nmoptysis, dyspnea, site‚Äêspecific pain) and side‚Äêeffects from therapy\\n\\n(i.e., hair loss, neuropathy, sore mouth, dysphagia). [9] All responses to\\n\\n\\nitems are normalized to a 0‚Äì100 scale using a standard scoring al\\ngorithm. [10] For functioning and GHS/QoL scales, higher scores\\n\\n\\ncorrespond to a better level of functioning and QoL. For symptom\\n\\n\\nscales, a higher score corresponds to a higher level of symptom\\n\\n\\nseverity. Thus, a negative change from baseline in symptom scales\\n\\n\\ncorresponds to an improvement and a positive change corresponds\\n\\n\\nto deterioration. Conversely, a negative change from baseline in\\n\\n\\nfunctioning and GHS/QoL scales corresponds to deterioration, and a\\n\\n\\npositive change corresponds to improvement. **Statistical analysis**\\n\\n\\nAll PRO analyses presented are prespecified and used the full analysis\\n\\n\\nset (FAS), defined as all patients to whom study treatment was assigned\\n\\n\\nby randomization. Time‚Äêto‚Äêevent analyses were performed on the FAS. The longitudinal change‚Äêfrom‚Äêbaseline analyses were done on the FAS\\n\\n\\nwith patients who had a baseline PRO assessment and at least one PRO\\n\\n\\nassessment after baseline. Completion rates were summarized. To estimate longitudinal changes from baseline in EORTC QLQ‚Äê\\n\\n\\nC30 and QLQ‚ÄêLC13 scales, we used a longitudinal mixed‚Äêeffects\\n\\n\\nmodel for repeated measures (MMRM) with time, therapy, therapy\\n\\n\\nby time, histology (nonsquamous, squamous), PD‚ÄêL1 expression level\\n\\n\\n(<1%, 1‚Äì49%, ‚â•50%), baseline, and baseline by time as covariates. This MMRM analysis was performed on the changes from baseline\\n\\n\\nfor EORTC QLQ‚ÄêC30 and QLQ‚ÄêLC13 scales; overall change from\\n\\n\\nbaseline was estimated using least square means across time points. We also performed an analysis of time to definitive clinically mean\\n\\ningful deterioration (TTD) in all functioning and symptom scales. We\\n\\n\\ndefined definitive clinically meaningful deterioration in GHS/QoL and\\n\\n\\nfunctioning scales as the time from randomization to the first\\n\\n\\nobservation with a greater than or equal to 10‚Äêpoint decrease and no\\n\\n\\nsubsequent observations with a less than 10‚Äêpoint decrease from\\n\\n\\nbaseline or until patient drop‚Äêout resulting in missing data. In the\\n\\n\\ncase of missing items, the scores were calculated as indicated in the\\n\\n\\nscoring manuals for each of the PRO instruments. No imputation of\\n\\n\\nthe items was performed. We defined definitive clinically meaningful deterioration in the\\n\\n\\nsymptom scales as the time from randomization to the first\\n\\n\\nobservation with a greater than or equal to 10‚Äêpoint increase and\\n\\n\\nno subsequent observations with a less than 10‚Äêpoint increase\\n\\n\\nfrom baseline or until patient drop‚Äêout resulting in missing data. Established 10‚Äêpoint threshold value for minimally important dif\\nferences from the patient perspective were used. [11] Patients who\\n\\n\\ndid not satisfy the deterioration criteria were censored at the time\\n\\n\\nof last available PRO assessment. Survival analysis methods used\\n\\n\\nthe Kaplan‚ÄìMeier approach for estimating medians and percen\\n\\ntiles, the Brookmeyer and Crowley method for computing 95%\\n\\n\\nconfidence intervals (CIs), the stratified Cox proportional hazards\\n\\n\\nmodel assuming proportional hazards for computing hazard ratio\\n\\n\\n(HR), and the stratified log‚Äêrank test in comparing TTD between\\n\\n\\ntreatment arms. The same stratification factors used for random\\n\\nization (Figure S1) were applied to both the stratified log‚Äêrank test\\n\\n\\nand the stratified Cox model. Statistical comparisons were made at\\n\\n\\nŒ± = 0.05, and two‚Äêsided _p_ values were calculated with no multi\\n\\nplicity adjustments made. All analyses were conducted using Sta\\n\\ntistical Analysis System 9.4 software (SAS Institute, Cary, North\\n\\n\\nCarolina). **RESULTS**\\n\\n\\nThe FAS population comprised 466 patients: 312 were assigned to\\n\\n\\nreceive cemiplimab plus chemotherapy and 154 to receive placebo\\n\\n\\nplus chemotherapy. In the cemiplimab plus chemotherapy arm, 154\\n\\n\\npatients received paclitaxel plus carboplatin, 117 pemetrexed plus\\n\\n\\ncarboplatin, 24 pemetrexed plus cisplatin, and 17 paclitaxel plus\\n\\n\\ncisplatin. In the placebo plus chemotherapy arm, those who received\\n\\n\\nthese therapies were 83, 45, 17, and 8, respectively (Figure S2). One\\n\\n\\n(0.7%) patient who was randomized to receive placebo plus chemo\\n\\ntherapy withdrew consent before being treated (Table S1, Figure S2). In EMPOWER‚ÄêLung 3, 84.3% and 14.8% of patients had Eastern\\n\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nMAKHARADZE ET AL . Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 1 and 0,\\n\\n\\nrespectively (Table S1). For every cycle from baseline to cycle 21, ‚â•92% of patients in\\n\\n\\nthe cemiplimab plus chemotherapy arm and ‚â•91% in the placebo plus\\n\\n\\nchemotherapy arm completed at least one question on the EORTC\\n\\n\\nQLQ‚ÄêC30; similarly, ‚â•92% and ‚â•91% of patients, respectively,\\n\\n\\ncompleted at least one question on the EORTC QLQ‚ÄêLC13 (Tables S2\\n\\n\\nand 3); additional information regarding completion rates of patients\\n\\n\\nwho completed at least one question at each time point can be found\\n\\n\\nin Tables S2 and S3. **Patient‚ÄêReported QLQ‚ÄêC30 GHS/QoL**\\n\\n\\nBaseline mean scores for GHS/QoL were broadly similar in the\\n\\n\\ncemiplimab plus chemotherapy and placebo plus chemotherapy arms\\n\\n\\n(59.4, 95% CI, 57.4‚Äì61.4 vs. 58.7, 95% CI, 56.0‚Äì61.4, respectively). Baseline scores in the study were within the range of reference\\n\\nvalues published previously [12] in patients with NSCLC (Table 1). The between‚Äêtreatment comparison of GHS/QoL scores based\\n\\n\\non MMRM analyses showed a non‚Äìstatistically significant overall\\n\\n\\ndifference from baseline between the two treatment arms (differ\\n\\nence, 0.61; 95% CI, ‚Äì2.23 to 3.45, _p_ = .673) (Figure 1A). In Figure 2A, based on the 95% CIs, a statistically significant\\n\\n\\noverall improvement from baseline was observed in the cemiplimab\\n\\n\\nplus chemotherapy arm (1.69; 95% CI, 0.20‚Äì3.19) whereas no sig\\n\\nnificant overall change from baseline was observed in the placebo\\n\\n\\nplus chemotherapy arm (1.08; 95% CI, ‚Äì1.34 to 3.51). We observed a trend toward a delay in TTD of GHS/QoL in the\\n\\n\\ncemiplimab plus chemotherapy arm versus the placebo plus chemo\\n\\ntherapy arm (medians not reached), with an HR of 0.78 (95% CI,\\n\\n\\n0.51‚Äì1.19, _p_ = .248) (Figure 3A). **Patient‚Äêreported QLQ‚ÄêC30 functioning scales**\\n\\n\\nBaseline scores for QLQ‚ÄêC30 functioning scales were broadly similar\\n\\n\\nbetween treatment arms, with higher functioning levels in both arms\\n\\n\\nexcept physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning,\\n\\n\\nand cognitive functioning, when compared with reference values\\n\\n\\n(Table 1). No significant differences in any function scales were observed\\n\\n\\nbetween‚Äêtreatment comparisons of the overall change from baseline\\n\\n\\nscores (Figure 1A). Based on the 95% CIs, the overall change from baseline within\\n\\n\\neach treatment arm indicated a statistically significant overall\\n\\n\\nimprovement for cemiplimab plus chemotherapy in emotional func\\n\\ntioning (3.82; 95% CI, 2.36‚Äì5.29), and statistically significant overall\\n\\n\\nworsening in cognitive functioning (‚àí1.47; 95% CI, ‚Äì2.78 to ‚àí0.16)\\n\\n\\nand social functioning (‚àí2.29; 95% CI, ‚Äì4.31 to ‚àí0.28) (Figure 2A). In\\n\\n\\nthe placebo plus chemotherapy arm, a statistically significant overall\\n\\n\\nimprovement from baseline in emotional functioning (2.51; 95% CI,\\n\\n\\n0.10‚Äì4.92) and a statistically significant overall worsening from\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                 - **2259**\\n\\n\\nbaseline in physical functioning (‚àí2.99; 95% CI, ‚Äì5.61 to ‚àí0.37) were\\n\\n\\nobserved (Figure 2A). Treatment with cemiplimab plus chemotherapy also significantly\\n\\n\\ndelayed TTD in physical functioning (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.42‚Äì0.91,\\n\\n\\n_p_ = .014) (Figure 3B), role functioning (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.36‚Äì0.76,\\n\\n\\n_p_ = .0005), and emotional functioning (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.31‚Äì0.88,\\n\\n\\n_p_ = .013) (Figure S3) compared with the overall placebo plus\\n\\n\\nchemotherapy arm. **Patient‚Äêreported QLQ‚ÄêC30 symptom scales**\\n\\n\\nAcross all EORTC QLQ‚ÄêC30 symptom scales in both treatment arms,\\n\\n\\nmean baseline scores were broadly similar. Compared with reference\\n\\n\\nvalues, baseline scores for the symptoms indicated low symptom\\n\\n\\nseverity in both treatment arms (Table 1). Between‚Äêtreatment comparison in overall change from baseline\\n\\n\\nscores indicated a statistically significant difference in favor of\\n\\n\\ncemiplimab plus chemotherapy for pain (‚àí4.98; 95% CI, ‚Äì8.36 to\\n\\n\\n‚àí1.60, _p_ = .004) (Figure 1B). No statistically significant between‚Äê\\n\\n\\ntreatment overall difference from baseline was observed for all\\n\\n\\nother QLQ‚ÄêC30 symptom scales (Figure 1B).

Recently published Amer\\n\\nican Society of Clinical Oncology Value Framework in the advanced\\n\\n\\ndisease setting and the European Society for Medical Oncology\\n\\n\\nMagnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale guidance highlighted the impor\\n\\ntance of a comprehensive assessment of the value of medicine that\\n\\nincludes not only efficacy and safety but also PROs. [13,14] Data pre\\n\\nsented here are, to the best of our knowledge, the first ever detailed\\n\\n\\ncancer‚Äêrelated and lung cancer‚Äìspecific PROs in patients receiving\\n\\n\\nfirst‚Äêline cemiplimab plus chemotherapy who have advanced NSCLC\\n\\n\\nregardless of histology or PD‚ÄêL1 expression. We show that the\\n\\n\\nfavorable efficacy achieved with cemiplimab plus chemotherapy over\\n\\n\\nplacebo plus chemotherapy is accompanied by significant overall\\n\\n\\nimprovement in pain and significant delay in TTD in multiple patient‚Äê\\n\\n\\nreported cancer‚Äêrelated and lung cancer‚Äìspecific functions and\\n\\n\\nsymptoms. When comparing between treatment arms, none of the\\n\\n\\nanalyses yielded statistically significant PRO results favoring the\\n\\n\\nplacebo plus chemotherapy arm. Systemic therapy with platinum‚Äêbased doublet chemotherapy\\n\\n\\nregimens, with or without maintenance therapy, was until recently\\n\\n\\nthe standard of care for first‚Äêline treatment of patients with\\n\\n\\nadvanced NSCLC whose tumors do not have an _EGFR_ mutation, an\\n\\n\\n_ALK_ mutation, or an _ROS1_ fusion. [15‚Äì17] The introduction of immuno\\n\\ntherapy in combination with chemotherapy in metastatic NSCLC has\\n\\nimproved OS, progression‚Äêfree survival, [18‚Äì20] and QoL. [21,22] Our re\\n\\nsults further support the positive benefit‚Äêrisk profile of cemiplimab\\n\\n\\nplus chemotherapy combination therapy and show that cemiplimab\\n\\n\\nplus platinum‚Äêbased doublet chemotherapy may not impose toxicities\\n\\n\\nthat interfere with QoL in patients with advanced NSCLC. Although for every cycle from baseline to cycle 30, >85% and\\n\\n\\n>87% of patients in the cemiplimab plus chemotherapy and placebo\\n\\n\\nplus chemotherapy arms, respectively, completed at least one ques\\n\\ntion (baseline and post baseline) on each of the EORTC question\\n\\nnaires, the results may have overrepresented the patients who did\\n\\n\\nwell in both treatment arms because patients who progressed no\\n\\n\\nlonger completed the questionnaires. Future studies should also\\n\\n\\nincorporate the reasons for noncompletion of these questionnaires. Another limitation was that differences in baseline EORTC QLQ‚ÄêC30\\n\\n\\nand QLQ‚ÄêLC13 scores were compared to published EORTC refer\\n\\nence values, which may limit the generalizability of these results to\\n\\n\\nreal‚Äêworld patients with NSCLC; no adjustments were made for\\n\\n\\nmultiplicity. Patients receiving treatment for advanced NSCLC may be\\n\\n\\nsymptomatic, with significant impairment in daily activity and work\\n\\nproductivity. [4,23] Moreover, substantial burden on QoL from lung\\n\\ncancer‚Äìassociated symptoms including pain, dyspnea, and cough [3,4]\\n\\nhave been associated with changes in ECOG performance status. [9]\\n\\n\\nDespite 84.3% and 14.8% of patients in EMPOWER‚ÄêLung 3 having\\n\\n\\nECOG performance status of 1 and 0, respectively, the significant\\n\\n\\ndelay in TTD in these symptoms observed in EMPOWER‚ÄêLung 3\\n\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**2262**\\n\\n\\n\\n- PROS OF 1L CEMIPLIMAB + CHEMOTHERAPY IN ANSCLC\\n\\n\\n\\n**F I G U R E 2** Estimated overall change from baseline (MMRM) in full analysis set.

In addition, approximately 39% of patients\\n\\n\\nwith advanced NSCLC have brain metastases [24] with common\\n\\n\\nmanifestations of pain, nausea/vomiting, and headache. [25] Our re\\n\\nsults showed that cemiplimab plus chemotherapy led to a significant\\n\\n\\noverall improvement and a significant delay in TTD in pain symp\\n\\ntoms compared with platinum‚Äêbased doublet chemotherapy alone. Treatment with cemiplimab plus chemotherapy also significantly\\n\\n\\ndelayed TTD in physical functioning, role functioning, emotional\\n\\n\\nfunctioning, dyspnea, nausea/vomiting, constipation, and most QLQ‚Äê\\n\\n\\nLC13 symptoms compared with placebo plus chemotherapy. Delay\\n\\n\\nin TTD in physical and role functions are particularly pertinent,\\n\\n\\ngiven the anticipated continued improvements in cancer survivor\\nship among patients with advanced NSCLC. [26,27] Future studies\\n\\n\\nshould also incorporate the collection of PROs pertaining to\\n\\n\\nimmune‚Äêrelated or symptomatic toxicities related to checkpoint\\n\\n\\ninhibitors. As disease progression may negatively affect QoL, delaying\\n\\n\\nprogression could slow the deterioration in QoL, except for any sig\\n\\nnificant detrimental treatment‚Äêrelated toxicity. In EMPOWER‚ÄêLung\\n\\n\\n3, we observed low rates of adverse events leading to discontinua\\n\\ntion, and a safety profile generally consistent with those known for\\n\\n\\ncemiplimab and for platinum‚Äêbased chemotherapy. The positive PRO\\n\\n\\nresults observed in EMPOWER‚ÄêLung 3 suggest that, overall, the\\n\\n\\nadverse events did not detrimentally affect QoL in patients treated\\n\\n\\n\\nwith cemiplimab plus chemotherapy compared with platinum‚Äêbased\\n\\n\\ndoublet chemotherapy alone from a patient's perspective. Favorable PRO results of cemiplimab monotherapy in advanced\\n\\nNSCLC with PD‚ÄêL1 expression ‚â•50% [5] and from pembrolizumab in\\n\\n\\ncombination with chemotherapy among patients with metastatic\\n\\nNSCLC regardless of PD‚ÄêL1 expression [21,22] suggest an encouraging\\n\\n\\noutlook with respect to the effects of PD‚Äê1 inhibitors on QoL. Our\\n\\n\\nobserved positive cancer‚Äêrelated and lung cancer‚Äìspecific PROs\\n\\n\\nsupport the concept that the superior efficacy and favorable safety\\n\\n\\nprofile of cemiplimab plus chemotherapy translate to better PROs\\n\\n\\ncompared with platinum‚Äêbased doublet chemotherapy alone in pa\\n\\ntients with advanced NSCLC regardless of histology and PD‚ÄêL1\\n\\n\\nexpression. **AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS**\\n\\n\\n**Tamta Makharadze:** Investigation, writing‚Äìreview and editing, and\\n\\n\\nformal analysis. **Ruben G.

This study evaluated\\n\\npatient‚Äêreported outcomes (PROs). **Methods:** PROs were assessed at day 1 (baseline), the start of each treatment cycle\\n\\n\\n(every 3 weeks) for the first six doses, and then at start of every three cycles, using\\n\\n\\nthe European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality\\n\\n\\nof Life‚ÄêCore 30 (QLQ‚ÄêC30) and Quality of Life‚ÄêLung Cancer Module (QLQ‚ÄêLC13)\\n\\n\\nquestionnaires. Prespecified analyses included a longitudinal mixed‚Äêeffect model\\n\\n\\ncomparing treatment arms and a time to definitive clinically meaningful deteriora\\n\\ntion (TTD) analysis performed for global health status/quality of life (GHS/QoL) and\\n\\n\\nall scales from the questionnaires.

For pain symptoms\\n\\n\\n‚àí\\n(EORTC QLQ‚ÄêC30), a statistically significant overall improvement from baseline ( 4.98,\\n\\n\\n95% confidence interval [CI] ‚àí8.36 to ‚àí1.60, _p_ = .004) and a statistically significant\\n\\n\\ndelay in TTD (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.26‚Äì0.60, _p_ < .0001) favoring cemipli\\n\\nmab plus chemotherapy were observed. Statistically significant delays in TTD, all\\n\\n\\nfavoring cemiplimab plus chemotherapy, were also observed in functioning and symp\\n\\ntom scales. A significant overall improvement from baseline in GHS/QoL was seen for\\n\\n\\ncemiplimab plus chemotherapy compared with nonsignificant overall change from\\n\\n\\nbaseline for placebo plus chemotherapy (1.69, 95% CI, 0.20‚Äì3.19 vs. 1.08, 95% CI, ‚Äì1.34\\n\\n\\nto 3.51; between arms, _p_ = .673). No analyses yielded statistically significant PRO\\n\\n\\nresults favoring placebo plus chemotherapy for any QLQ‚ÄêC30 or QLQ‚ÄêLC13 scale. **Conclusion:** Cemiplimab plus chemotherapy resulted in significant overall\\n\\n\\nimprovement in pain symptoms and delayed TTD in cancer‚Äêrelated and lung cancer‚Äì\\n\\n\\nspecific symptoms and functions. **K E Y W O R D S**\\n\\nadvanced non‚Äìsmall cell lung cancer, cemiplimab, non‚Äìsmall cell lung cancer, patient‚Äêreported\\n\\noutcome, quality of life\\n\\n\\n\\n**INTRODUCTION**\\n\\n\\nIn the EMPOWER‚ÄêLung 3 trial (NCT03409614), the efficacy and\\n\\n\\nsafety of cemiplimab‚Äîa human immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal\\n\\n\\nantibody to the programmed cell death‚Äê1 (PD‚Äê1) receptor‚Äîplus in\\n\\nvestigator's choice of platinum‚Äêdoublet chemotherapy were\\n\\n\\ncompared with placebo plus chemotherapy for the first‚Äêline treat\\n\\nment of patients with advanced squamous or nonsquamous non‚Äì\\n\\n\\nsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) regardless of PD‚Äêligand 1 (PD‚ÄêL1)\\n\\n\\nexpression and with no anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( _ALK_ ), epidermal\\n\\n\\ngrowth factor receptor ( _EGFR_ ), or c‚ÄêRos oncogene 1 ( _ROS1_ ) aberra\\n\\ntions. Primary results showed clinically meaningful and statistically\\n\\n\\nsignificant improvement in overall survival (OS) and progression‚Äêfree\\n\\nsurvival versus placebo plus chemotherapy. [1]\\n\\n\\nTreatments often intend to extend OS and maintain or improve\\n\\n\\nquality of life (QoL); however, treatment‚Äêrelated toxicity can\\n\\n\\n\\ndeteriorate QoL among patients with advanced NSCLC. [2] The\\n\\n\\nimprovement, maintenance, or delay in deterioration in QoL is an\\n\\n\\nimportant goal in advanced NSCLC, for which treatment is palliative. Disease‚Äêrelated symptoms of pain, dyspnea, and cough are reported\\n\\nto have a substantial negative effect on lung cancer‚Äìspecific QoL. [3,4]\\n\\n\\nWhen assessing novel therapies, it is therefore necessary to consider\\n\\n\\npatient‚Äêreported outcomes (PROs) as a key component of benefit‚Äê\\n\\n\\nrisk profile evaluation. Such measurements are important when\\n\\n\\ndetermining the quality of the time gained by delaying cancer pro\\n\\ngression and improving survival. Cemiplimab monotherapy was\\n\\n\\nshown in the EMPOWER‚ÄêLung 1 trial to significantly improve QoL,\\n\\n\\nfunctioning, and most symptoms versus platinum‚Äêdoublet chemo\\n\\ntherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC and PD‚ÄêL1 expression\\n\\n‚â•50%. [5] Top‚Äêlevel PRO results of EMPOWER‚ÄêLung 3 were recently\\n\\npresented. [6] This study reports detailed cancer‚Äêrelated and lung\\n\\n\\ncancer‚Äìspecific PROs from the EMPOWER‚ÄêLung 3 trial. -----\\n\\n**2258**\\n\\n\\n\\n- PROS OF 1L CEMIPLIMAB + CHEMOTHERAPY IN ANSCLC\\n\\n\\n\\n**MATERIALS AND METHODS**\\n\\n\\n**Study design and participants**\\n\\n\\nThe EMPOWER‚ÄêLung 3 study [7] was a multicenter, multinational,\\n\\n\\nrandomized, placebo‚Äêcontrolled, double‚Äêblind, phase 3 trial\\n\\n\\ncomparing the efficacy, safety, and PROs of cemiplimab (350 mg)\\n\\n\\nevery 3 weeks intravenous plus investigator's choice of platinum‚Äê\\n\\n\\ndoublet chemotherapy (paclitaxel plus carboplatin or cisplatin,\\n\\n\\npemetrexed plus carboplatin or cisplatin) versus placebo plus\\n\\n\\nchemotherapy using 2:1 randomization in patients with stage IIIB,\\n\\n\\nIIIC, or stage IV nonsquamous or squamous NSCLC with no _EGFR_\\n\\n\\nmutation, _ALK_ mutation, or _ROS1_ fusion (Figure S1). **PRO assessments**\\n\\n\\nPROs were assessed as secondary end points using the European\\n\\n\\nOrganisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life‚Äê\\n\\n\\nCore 30 (EORTC QLQ‚ÄêC30, version 3.0) questionnaire and its Lung\\n\\n\\nCancer Module (QLQ‚ÄêLC13) using patient self‚Äêadministered paper\\n\\n\\nforms at day 1 (baseline), the start of each treatment cycle (every\\n\\n\\n3 weeks) for the first six doses, then at the start of every three cycles,\\n\\n\\nand at the end of treatment, or end of study for patients who dis\\n\\ncontinued treatment due to progressive disease. The EORTC QLQ‚ÄêC30 is a clinically validated measure of QoL\\n\\n\\ncomprising five multi‚Äêitem functioning subscales, three multi‚Äêitem\\n\\n\\nsymptom scales, a global health status (GHS)/QoL subscale, and six\\n\\n\\nsingle‚Äêitem symptom scales assessing other disease‚Äê and treatment‚Äê\\n\\nrelated symptoms. [8] The EORTC QLQ‚ÄêLC13 is a clinically validated\\n\\n\\nlung cancer‚Äìspecific module comprising multi‚Äêitem and single‚Äêitem\\n\\n\\nmeasures of lung cancer‚Äìassociated symptoms (i.e., coughing, he\\n\\nmoptysis, dyspnea, site‚Äêspecific pain) and side‚Äêeffects from therapy\\n\\n(i.e., hair loss, neuropathy, sore mouth, dysphagia). [9] All responses to\\n\\n\\nitems are normalized to a 0‚Äì100 scale using a standard scoring al\\ngorithm. [10] For functioning and GHS/QoL scales, higher scores\\n\\n\\ncorrespond to a better level of functioning and QoL. For symptom\\n\\n\\nscales, a higher score corresponds to a higher level of symptom\\n\\n\\nseverity. Thus, a negative change from baseline in symptom scales\\n\\n\\ncorresponds to an improvement and a positive change corresponds\\n\\n\\nto deterioration. Conversely, a negative change from baseline in\\n\\n\\nfunctioning and GHS/QoL scales corresponds to deterioration, and a\\n\\n\\npositive change corresponds to improvement. **Statistical analysis**\\n\\n\\nAll PRO analyses presented are prespecified and used the full analysis\\n\\n\\nset (FAS), defined as all patients to whom study treatment was assigned\\n\\n\\nby randomization. Time‚Äêto‚Äêevent analyses were performed on the FAS. The longitudinal change‚Äêfrom‚Äêbaseline analyses were done on the FAS\\n\\n\\nwith patients who had a baseline PRO assessment and at least one PRO\\n\\n\\nassessment after baseline. Completion rates were summarized. To estimate longitudinal changes from baseline in EORTC QLQ‚Äê\\n\\n\\nC30 and QLQ‚ÄêLC13 scales, we used a longitudinal mixed‚Äêeffects\\n\\n\\nmodel for repeated measures (MMRM) with time, therapy, therapy\\n\\n\\nby time, histology (nonsquamous, squamous), PD‚ÄêL1 expression level\\n\\n\\n(<1%, 1‚Äì49%, ‚â•50%), baseline, and baseline by time as covariates. This MMRM analysis was performed on the changes from baseline\\n\\n\\nfor EORTC QLQ‚ÄêC30 and QLQ‚ÄêLC13 scales; overall change from\\n\\n\\nbaseline was estimated using least square means across time points. We also performed an analysis of time to definitive clinically mean\\n\\ningful deterioration (TTD) in all functioning and symptom scales. We\\n\\n\\ndefined definitive clinically meaningful deterioration in GHS/QoL and\\n\\n\\nfunctioning scales as the time from randomization to the first\\n\\n\\nobservation with a greater than or equal to 10‚Äêpoint decrease and no\\n\\n\\nsubsequent observations with a less than 10‚Äêpoint decrease from\\n\\n\\nbaseline or until patient drop‚Äêout resulting in missing data. In the\\n\\n\\ncase of missing items, the scores were calculated as indicated in the\\n\\n\\nscoring manuals for each of the PRO instruments. No imputation of\\n\\n\\nthe items was performed. We defined definitive clinically meaningful deterioration in the\\n\\n\\nsymptom scales as the time from randomization to the first\\n\\n\\nobservation with a greater than or equal to 10‚Äêpoint increase and\\n\\n\\nno subsequent observations with a less than 10‚Äêpoint increase\\n\\n\\nfrom baseline or until patient drop‚Äêout resulting in missing data. Established 10‚Äêpoint threshold value for minimally important dif\\nferences from the patient perspective were used. [11] Patients who\\n\\n\\ndid not satisfy the deterioration criteria were censored at the time\\n\\n\\nof last available PRO assessment. Survival analysis methods used\\n\\n\\nthe Kaplan‚ÄìMeier approach for estimating medians and percen\\n\\ntiles, the Brookmeyer and Crowley method for computing 95%\\n\\n\\nconfidence intervals (CIs), the stratified Cox proportional hazards\\n\\n\\nmodel assuming proportional hazards for computing hazard ratio\\n\\n\\n(HR), and the stratified log‚Äêrank test in comparing TTD between\\n\\n\\ntreatment arms. The same stratification factors used for random\\n\\nization (Figure S1) were applied to both the stratified log‚Äêrank test\\n\\n\\nand the stratified Cox model. Statistical comparisons were made at\\n\\n\\nŒ± = 0.05, and two‚Äêsided _p_ values were calculated with no multi\\n\\nplicity adjustments made.\""

    "### üîπ **1. Recursive Character Splitter Chunking**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **How it works**\n",
    "  * Splits text by **characters** (not meaning), using a **hierarchy of separators**.\n",
    "  * Default separator order: `[\"\\n\\n\", \"\\n\", \" \", \"\"]`\n",
    "    ‚Üí it tries to split by **paragraph**, then **line**, then **space**, and if none work, finally by raw characters.\n",
    "  * It keeps splitting until chunks fit within `chunk_size`.\n",
    "  * Often used with **overlap** (e.g. `chunk_overlap=50`) so chunks share some context.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Example**\n",
    "  Text:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  LangChain is an open-source framework. \n",
    "  It helps build LLM-powered apps. \n",
    "  It has modules for retrieval, agents, and evaluation.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  With `chunk_size=50`:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Chunk 1: `\"LangChain is an open-source framework. It helps build\"`\n",
    "  * Chunk 2: `\"LLM-powered apps. It has modules for retrieval, agents,\"`\n",
    "  * Chunk 3: `\"and evaluation.\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "  Notice: Splits are based only on length, **not meaning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **When to use**\n",
    "  * You just need **guaranteed chunk sizes** for token limits.\n",
    "  * Text is fairly uniform and meaning isn‚Äôt critical per chunk (e.g., log files, simple documents).\n",
    "  * It‚Äôs **fast and cheap** (no embeddings required).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **2. Semantic Chunking**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **How it works**\n",
    "    * Splits text into **sentences**.\n",
    "    * Embeds each sentence ‚Üí measures **semantic distance** between neighbors.\n",
    "    * Uses a **breakpoint strategy** (Percentile, Std Dev, IQR, Gradient) to decide where topics shift.\n",
    "    * Forms chunks that are **coherent in meaning**, not just length.\n",
    "    * Extra options like `buffer_size`, `min_chunk_size`, etc. refine the splits.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Example**\n",
    "    Same text:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    LangChain is an open-source framework. \n",
    "    It helps build LLM-powered apps. \n",
    "    It has modules for retrieval, agents, and evaluation.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    Semantic similarity is high across sentences ‚Üí **no breakpoints**.\n",
    "    ‚Üí The whole passage may remain one chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If we add a new sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Recently, NASA announced a new Mars mission.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    The distance between ‚ÄúLangChain modules‚Ä¶‚Äù and ‚ÄúNASA mission‚Äù would be **large**, so a breakpoint is created ‚Üí 2 chunks:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Chunk 1: LangChain-related sentences\n",
    "    * Chunk 2: NASA mission\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **When to use**\n",
    "    * You need chunks to be **semantically meaningful** (for retrieval, QA, summarization).\n",
    "    * Works best with **long, topic-rich documents** (reports, articles, transcripts).\n",
    "    * More **expensive** (needs embeddings) and a bit slower.\n",
