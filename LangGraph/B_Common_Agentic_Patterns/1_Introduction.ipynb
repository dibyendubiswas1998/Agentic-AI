    "# **Common Agetic Pattern:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In **LangGraph**, an **agentic pattern** refers to a design or workflow where multiple agents (autonomous entities or components) collaborate to achieve a task. These agents can interact with each other, make decisions, and take actions based on the context of the task. A common agentic pattern involves **orchestrating multiple agents** to work together in a structured manner, often passing control between them based on specific conditions or states. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components of an Agentic Pattern:** <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agent:**\n",
    "    * Autonomous entities that perform specific tasks (e.g., generating text, answering questions, making decisions).\n",
    "    * Each agent has a defined role and can interact with other agents or external systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **State:**\n",
    "    * A shared state or context that is updated as the agents perform their tasks.\n",
    "    * The state contains information about the current progress, inputs, outputs, and any intermediate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Transitions:**\n",
    "    * Rules or conditions that determine how control is passed between agents.\n",
    "    * Transitions are often based on the current state or the output of an agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Orchestrations:**\n",
    "    * The process of managing the flow of control between agents to ensure the task is completed efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "**Example of Agentic Pattern:** <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Letâ€™s consider a **customer support chatbot** that uses multiple agents to handle user queries. The agents collaborate to provide accurate and helpful responses. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenaro:** <br>\n",
    "A user asks the chatbot: \"How do I reset my password, and what are the security requirements?\" <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agentic Workflow:** <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Agent:**\n",
    "    * Receives the user query and preprocesses it (e.g., tokenization, intent detection).\n",
    "    * Updates the shared state with the user's query and detected intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Routing Agent:**\n",
    "    * Analyzes the query and determines which specialized agents should handle it.\n",
    "    * For this query, it identifies two tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "        * Task 1: Explain how to reset the password.\n",
    "        * Task 2: List the security requirements for passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Updates the state with the tasks and passes control to the appropriate agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Password Reset Agent:**\n",
    "    * Handles Task 1: Explains the steps to reset the password.\n",
    "    * Updates the state with the response for Task 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Security Requirements Agent:**\n",
    "    * Handles Task 2: Lists the security requirements for passwords (e.g., minimum length, special characters).\n",
    "    * Updates the state with the response for Task 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Aggregation Agent:**\n",
    "    * Combines the responses from the Password Reset Agent and Security Requirements Agent into a single coherent response.\n",
    "    * Updates the state with the final response.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Output Agent:**\n",
    "    * Formats the final response and sends it back to the user.\n",
    "    * Marks the task as complete in the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works:** <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State Initialization:** The shared state is initialized with the user's query.\n",
    "2. **Agent Execution:** Each agent performs its task, updates the state, and passes control to the next agent based on predefined rules.\n",
    "3. **State Updates:** The state evolves as agents complete their tasks, ensuring all necessary information is available for the next steps.\n",
    "4. **Final Output:** The final response is generated by aggregating the outputs of multiple agents and sent to the user.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Benefits of Agentic Patterns in LangGraph:** <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Modularity:** Each agent has a specific role, making the system easy to maintain and extend.\n",
    "* **Flxibility:** Agents can be added, removed, or modified without disrupting the overall workflow.\n",
    "* **Scalability:** Complex tasks can be broken down into smaller subtasks handled by specialized agents.\n",
    "* **Collaboration:** Agents work together, leveraging their individual strengths to achieve the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:** <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* A common agentic pattern in LangGraph involves orchestrating multiple agents to collaborate on a task.\n",
    "* The workflow is driven by a shared state and transitions between agents based on conditions or rules.\n",
    "* This pattern is highly effective for complex tasks like customer support, content generation, or decision-making."
