# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide and interact with context for Large Language Models (LLMs). Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications: just as USB-C provides a universal connection for hardware, MCP enables AI apps to connect with tools, APIs, databases, and files in a structured, modular, and scalable way.

## üöÄ Why MCP?

Modern LLM-based applications need to dynamically access and interact with diverse tools and data sources. Traditional RESTful APIs fall short because they:

- Require custom integration for every tool
- Lack persistent context and memory
- Don‚Äôt support dynamic tool discovery or bi-directional communication

**MCP solves this by offering:**

- üì¶ Dynamic, pluggable tools with self-describing schemas  
- üß† Context sharing across tools and sessions  
- üîÅ Asynchronous interactions (e.g., background jobs, notifications)  
- üìâ Reduced N√óM complexity in multi-tool integrations

## üß© Key Terminologies

### 1. MCP Host
- The LLM-powered application (e.g., a chat UI, IDE, or LangChain agent)
- Orchestrates interactions with tools but doesn‚Äôt connect directly to them
- Uses MCP Clients internally to make tool requests  
> _Example: Claude Desktop querying a Postgres database_

---

### 2. MCP Client
- The connector inside the Host
- Translates LLM requests to MCP messages using JSON-RPC
- Maintains 1:1 connection with MCP Servers  
> _Analogy: like a ‚Äúwaiter‚Äù taking orders from the LLM ‚Äúchef‚Äù_

---

### 3. MCP Server
- Lightweight service exposing one or more tools
- Self-describes its capabilities, inputs/outputs, and schemas
- Can wrap local or remote tools and data  
> _Example: A `Quiz Generator` server that takes topics and returns MCQs_

---

### 4. MCP Protocol
- Standard that defines how MCP Clients and Servers communicate
- Uses **JSON-RPC 2.0** over **stdio** or **HTTP + SSE**
- Enables:
  - Tool discovery
  - Structured inputs/outputs
  - Persistent memory
  - Bi-directional communication

## üîÑ Communication Between Components

### üîë **Step-by-Step Flow**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **User Input**
A user provides input (e.g., a question or command) to the system.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **MCP Client requests tool list**
The MCP Client (inside the MCP Host / Application) queries available MCP Servers to **find the list of tools** they provide.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **MCP Client collects tool descriptions**
The MCP Client **retrieves metadata** about the available tools from all MCP Servers (e.g., what methods they support, input/output schemas).

4Ô∏è‚É£ **LLM receives question + tool list**
The MCP Client gives the LLM the user‚Äôs question and the list of available tools for reasoning.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **LLM selects a specific tool for the task**
The LLM decides which tool(s) to call based on the user input and tool capabilities, then forms a tool request.

6Ô∏è‚É£ **MCP Client sends tool call**
The MCP Client forwards the LLM‚Äôs tool request (via JSON-RPC) to the **specific MCP Server** that hosts the tool.

7Ô∏è‚É£ **MCP Server processes and extracts context**
The MCP Server performs the requested operation (e.g., DB query, file processing, API call) and generates output.

8Ô∏è‚É£ **MCP Client returns tool response to LLM**
The result from the tool is passed back to the LLM for integration into its reasoning.

9Ô∏è‚É£ **LLM generates contextualized response**
The LLM uses the tool output as part of its overall response formulation.

üîü **Final output to user**
The user receives a rich, contextualized answer that combines the LLM‚Äôs reasoning and the tool‚Äôs output.

## üß™ Real-World Example: K12 Chatbot with Agentic Capabilities

**Scenario**: You're building an AI chatbot for students that can:

- Answer subject questions (Math, Science)
- Generate MCQs or quizzes
- Summarize textbooks
- Solve equations and generate charts

### Architecture

| Component      | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **MCP Host**   | LLM-powered chatbot interface with memory and tool orchestration |
| **MCP Client** | Connector inside the host that discovers tools and invokes servers |
| **MCP Servers**| Tool providers (e.g., `quiz_generator`, `math_solver`, `textbook_reader`) |
| **MCP Protocol**| JSON-RPC-based protocol enabling real-time, contextual communication |

> Example Tools as MCP Servers:
> - `textbook_reader` (markdown/PDF parser)
> - `quiz_generator` (returns topic-based MCQs)
> - `math_solver` (evaluates and graphs equations)
> - `video_explainer` (calls APIs for animated tutorials)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security, Scalability & Design Considerations

### ‚úÖ Security & Isolation
- Each MCP Server runs in isolation (process/container)
- Prevents unauthorized access between tools
- Enables sandboxing for untrusted tools (e.g., code executors)

### üîÑ Scalability & Modularity
- Scale tools independently (e.g., deploy quiz and video servers separately)
- Tools can be developed, tested, and deployed independently
- Ideal for microservices or function-as-a-service platforms

## üìö Example Tool Definitions

Each MCP Server provides a schema describing the tools it offers:

```json
{
  "tool": "generate_quiz",
  "description": "Generate 5 MCQs on a given topic",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "topic": { "type": "string" },
      "difficulty": { "type": "string" }
    }
  },
  "output_schema": {
    "type": "array",
    "items": { "type": "object" }
  }
}
```

## üìå Conclusion
MCP is purpose-built for LLM-first architectures. It abstracts away the complexity of integrating and orchestrating tools, allowing AI agents to discover, invoke, and interact with them in real-time, with full context and modularity.
